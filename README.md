## Run Instructions

Need to have a webpacker server as well as the rails servers, so in separate terminal windows run:

* `rails s`
* `./bin/webpack-dev-server` 

This will be changed to `heroku local` once Heroku and the Procfile are set up.

## Development history

### Initial install: 
Note: Our app name is **rwrsr_demo**. Use something else if you like and replacing accordingly in these instructions.

`rails new rwrsr_demo --webpack=react -T`

-T flag prevents TestUnit from being installed, because we'll switch to Rspec in just a bit.

*Hint: Add the '--database=postgresql' flag to the command above to save the conversion step later on. Run `rails db:setup` and `rails db:migrate` after the 'rails new' command completes.*

Gets as far as 'Yay! You're on Rails'

### Convert to Haml:
* add `gem 'haml-rails'` to Gemfile
* convert existing templates with `rake haml:erb2haml`

### Use rspec for testing
* add `gem 'rspec-rails'` to Gemfile for both test and development (needs to be in development so generators work)
* `rails g rspec:install`
* Recall that we initialized the app with the -T option, so we don't need to remove any existing test settings or files.
* `rspec` runs, but there is nothing to test yet.

### Build first controller and demo page
* `rails g controller Site index`
* remove unneeded Site files, like .coffee, .scss, helpers, view tests (for now, at least)
* `rspec` runs and passes with a single test
* make site#index the root path (in routes.rb)
* add `=javascript_pack_tag 'hello_react'` to site#index
* webpacker is correctly adding 'Hello React!' to the page, which can be found at `/site/index` or root `/`.

### Set up for Heroku
* For Heroku, we need to use Postgres, so change sqlite3 to pg by replacing the sqlite3 gem with pg, and then updating the database.yml file. 
* Set up the database with `rails db:setup` and then `rails db:migrate`
* Create a Procfile and a local .env file. The .env file is *not* committed to the repo. At this point, it only contains the port number for use in development, `PORT=3000`.
* We can now start the development servers (rails server and webpack dev server) with a single command, `heroku local`.
* Create the Heroku app with `heroku apps:create rwrsr_demo`. (Note that I already have an Heroku account and Heroku Command Line tools installed.)
* Add the nodejs and ruby buildpacks to the remote Heroku app. I find this easiest to do in the app dashboard on Heroku, which can be found under 'Settings'.
* Push code to Heroku with `git push heroku`. (See note https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#deploying-code if deploying from a branch other than master.)
* The app should now be accessible at https://rwrsr-demo.herokuapp.com/.
* The local server can now be started with `heroku local` rather than having to start both the rails and webpacker servers in separate windows.

### Add Semantic UI
* Add the Semantic UI React package with `yarn add semantic-ui-react`. (Note: using **yarn**, not **npm install**.)
* Get the Semantic UI stylesheets with `gem 'semantic-ui-sass', git: 'https://github.com/doabit/semantic-ui-sass.git'`.
* Rename the default `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` to `app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss` and add a line to import the Semantic stylesheet: `@import "semantic-ui";`.
* Add some sample components to `hello_react.jsx` and it works!
